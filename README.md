# ML-Training-Models
Data is the most important part in building AI models. Data can be in different forms and formats. Data is usually in a table where each column is
a feature and each row is an instance. In Machine Learning, depending on the problem and type of data, the appropriate algorithm or algorithms is selected and modeling
is done with it. Kaggle.com is an excellent source of datasets. Working on datasets and modeling is a great exercise to become a professional in ML, that's why I
downloaded datasets from Kaggle.com and modeled on them, which I hope will be useful for you.
